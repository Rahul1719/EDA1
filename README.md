To Analyse Heart Disease indicators.


According to the CDC, heart disease is one of the leading causes of death for people of most races in the US (African Americans, American Indians and Alaska Natives, and white people). About half of all Americans (47%) have at least 1 of 3 key risk factors for heart disease: high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking. Other key indicator include diabetic status, obesity (high BMI), not getting enough physical activity or drinking too much alcohol. Detecting and preventing the factors that have the greatest impact on heart disease is very important in healthcare. Computational developments, in turn, allow the application of machine learning methods to detect "patterns" from the data that can predict a patient's condition.


Observations: 
> Our problem involve a tabular dataset with 18 variables in which we can find categorical and numerical variables and one of them is the target variable.
> We are going to Analyze different type of parameters which are given in the dataset and try to find out correlation between them.
> There are zero null values which will simply our work.
> Wow, these data suggest that not consuming alcohol has a correlation with suffering heart disease. But also this part would be advisable to consult with an expert.
> Given dataset states that males have the maximum number of Heart disease in comparison to females.
> We can easily say that there is  a positive correlation between get an Heart disease and be older.
> It also states that white people have more Heart disease cases comparison to others.
> And if your health status is poor then you might be under threat of an Heart disease comparison to other health conditions.
